# Changelog

All notable changes to `sidereon-core` are documented here.

## [0.10.0]

### Added

- Astrodynamics coverage for anomaly conversions, analytic Kepler propagation,
  equinoctial and modified-equinoctial elements, solar beta angle,
  RIC/RTN/LVLH relative frames, Clohessy-Wiltshire motion, angular separation,
  position angle, general body observation, almanac events, atmospheric drag
  force, orbital decay, source-agnostic ephemeris grid sampling, and
  terrain/DTED lookup.
- GNSS DCB/OSB bias ingestion, SBAS augmentation with decode and corrected SPP,
  SSR/HAS real-time corrections, and robust SPP with a fault
  detection/exclusion driver.
- Cache-first data acquisition support for SP3, IONEX, CLK, NAV, and SRTM
  terrain to DTED products, using a single sans-IO core catalog and bit-exact
  hgt to DTED conversion.

### Changed

- Rust, Python, C, WASM, and Elixir interfaces now expose uniform capability
  parity for the 0.10.0 surface.
- GNSS constellation labels now use conventional styling: GPS, GLONASS, Galileo,
  BeiDou, QZSS, NavIC, and SBAS.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release.

- SGP4/SDP4 propagation (Vallado port), TLE and OMM (KVN/XML/JSON) parsing.
- Coordinate and time transforms (TEME/GCRS/ITRS/geodetic/topocentric, leap
  seconds, UT1), Sun/Moon ephemeris, solid-earth tides.
- RINEX navigation/observation/clock and CRINEX parsing, SP3 load and merge,
  ANTEX antenna corrections, broadcast and precise ephemeris evaluation.
- GNSS positioning: SPP (with robust estimation), RTK (LAMBDA ambiguity
  resolution, dual-frequency, multi-GNSS), and static PPP.
- Carrier-phase combinations and cycle-slip detection, DOP, visibility and
  pass prediction, velocity/Doppler, and observation quality weighting.
- Conjunction assessment and collision probability.
